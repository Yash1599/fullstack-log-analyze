# üîç Fullstack Log Analyzer

## What is this project?

This is a **smart web application** that can look at computer log files and automatically find suspicious or unusual activities. Think of it as a detective for your website logs!

### What are logs?
Logs are like a diary for your website. Every time someone visits your website, downloads a file, or tries to access something, it gets written down in a log file. For example:
```
192.168.1.100 - - [10/Jan/2024:14:30:15 +0000] "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1" 200
```
This means: Someone from IP address 192.168.1.100 visited the homepage at 2:30 PM and it worked fine (status 200).

### What does this app do?
Our app reads these log files and uses **artificial intelligence** to spot problems like:
- üö® Hackers trying to break into admin pages
- üö® Someone making too many requests (like a robot attack)
- üö® Errors and failed attempts to access files
- üö® Unusual behavior that doesn't look normal

---

## üéØ How the AI Works (Simple Explanation)

Our app uses **two different methods** to catch bad guys:

### Method 1: Rule-Based Detection (Like a Security Guard)
Just like a security guard follows rules, our app has 3 simple rules:

1. **Too Many Requests Rule**: If the same person (IP address) makes more than 3 requests, flag it as suspicious
   - **Confidence**: 80% sure this is bad
   - **Why**: Real people don't usually click that fast

2. **Suspicious Pages Rule**: If someone tries to access admin pages or login pages
   - **Examples**: `/admin`, `/wp-login.php`
   - **Confidence**: 90% sure this is bad
   - **Why**: Hackers often try these common admin URLs

3. **Error Codes Rule**: If the website returns error codes (400, 404, 500, etc.)
   - **Confidence**: 70% sure this is bad
   - **Why**: Too many errors might mean someone is trying things they shouldn't

### Method 2: AI-Based Detection (Like a Smart Detective)
This is the really cool part! Our app uses machine learning:

1. **Training**: We first show the AI examples of "normal" log entries
2. **Learning**: The AI learns what normal behavior looks like
3. **Detection**: When it sees new logs, it can spot things that don't look normal

**Technical Details** (for curious minds):
- Uses `SentenceTransformer` to convert log text into numbers (vectors)
- Uses `IsolationForest` algorithm to find outliers
- Assumes 15% of logs might be anomalies

## üì• Step 1: Get the Code

First, download the project to your computer:

```bash
# Download the project
git clone <your-repository-url>

# Go into the project folder
cd fullstack-log-analyzer
```

---

## üèóÔ∏è Step 2: Set Up the Backend (The Brain)

The backend is like the brain of our app - it does all the smart analysis.

### 2.1: Go to the backend folder
```bash
cd backend
```

### 2.2: Create a safe space for Python packages
```bash
# Create a virtual environment (like a separate room for this project)
python -m venv venv

# Activate it (enter the room)
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 2.3: Install the required tools
```bash
# Install all the Python packages our app needs
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**What this installs:**
- `Flask` - Creates the web server
- `sentence-transformers` - The AI for understanding text
- `scikit-learn` - Machine learning tools
- `pymongo` - For storing data
- `flask-cors` - Lets the frontend talk to backend

### 2.4: Start the backend server
```bash
python app.py
```

You should see:
```
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:10000
```

**Keep this terminal window open!** The backend is now running and waiting for requests.

---

## üé® Step 3: Set Up the Frontend (The Face)

The frontend is the pretty website that users see and interact with.

### 3.1: Open a NEW terminal window
(Keep the backend running in the first terminal)

### 3.2: Go to the frontend folder
```bash
cd frontend
```

### 3.3: Install the website tools
```bash
# Install all the website packages
npm install
```

**What this installs:**
- `Next.js` - The website framework
- `React` - For interactive user interfaces
- `Bootstrap` - For pretty styling
- `Chart.js` - For showing graphs
- `Axios` - For talking to the backend

### 3.4: Start the frontend server
```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
 ‚ñ≤ Next.js 15.3.3
 - Local:        http://localhost:3000
```

## üìä Example Log Files for Testing

We've included 4 example log files in **two convenient locations**:

### üìÅ File Locations:
- **`data/`** folder (root of project) - For general testing
- **`backend/sample_logs/`** folder - For easy backend testing and development

### üéØ Available Files:

### 1. `example1_normal.log` - Clean Traffic
**What's in it**: Normal website visitors doing normal things
- People viewing homepage, about page, contact page
- All requests successful (status code 200)
- Different IP addresses (real users)

**Expected Result**: Very few or no anomalies detected

### 2. `example2_suspicious.log` - Hacker Attack
**What's in it**: Someone trying to hack the website
- One IP address making many requests (rule violation)
- Trying to access `/admin` and `/wp-login.php` (suspicious pages)
- Getting error codes like 401, 403, 404, 500

**Expected Result**: Many anomalies detected with high confidence

### 3. `example3_mixed.log` - Real World Scenario
**What's in it**: Mix of normal users and suspicious activity
- Most traffic is normal
- Some failed attempts to access admin pages
- One IP making too many requests
- Some 404 errors (page not found)

**Expected Result**: Some anomalies detected, showing the AI can distinguish good from bad

### 4. `example4_realworld.log` - Advanced Attack Patterns
**What's in it**: Realistic web attack scenarios you might see in production
- **Normal users**: Regular visitors browsing legitimate pages
- **WordPress attacks**: Attempts to find `/wp-admin`, `/wp-login.php`
- **Database hunting**: Looking for `/phpmyadmin`, `/mysql`, `/.env`
- **API attacks**: Unauthorized attempts to access `/api/` endpoints
- **Config file searches**: Trying to find sensitive files like `config.php`, `backup.sql`

**Expected Result**: Multiple attack patterns detected with varying confidence levels

### üîß How to Access Sample Files:

#### From Web Interface:
1. Navigate to either `data/` or `backend/sample_logs/` folder
2. Select any of the example files when uploading
3. Click "Upload and Analyze"

#### From Python Code (Backend Development):
```python
from anomaly import parse_log_file

# Use files from backend/sample_logs/ for easy testing
results = parse_log_file('sample_logs/example1_normal.log')
print(f"Found {len([r for r in results if r['anomaly']])} anomalies")
```

---

## üîß Understanding the Results

When you upload a log file, you'll see:

### Summary Cards
- **Total Logs**: How many log entries were analyzed
- **Anomalies Found**: How many suspicious entries were detected
- **Clean Logs**: How many normal entries were found
- **Average Confidence**: How sure the AI is about its detections

### Charts
- **Pie Chart**: Shows the proportion of normal vs. suspicious logs
- **Bar Chart**: Shows different types of anomalies found

### Detailed Table
For each suspicious log entry, you'll see:
- **IP Address**: Where the request came from
- **Request**: What they were trying to access
- **Status Code**: Whether it worked or failed
- **Reason**: Why our AI thinks it's suspicious
- **Confidence**: How sure the AI is (0% to 100%)

```env
# Database connection
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/loganalyzer

# JWT secret for user authentication
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-here

# Flask settings
FLASK_ENV=development
FLASK_DEBUG=True
```

### Frontend Environment Variables
Create a file called `.env.local` in the `frontend/` folder:
```env
# Backend API URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:10000
```
